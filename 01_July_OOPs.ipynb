    "1. **Encapsulation:** This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal details of how an object works and exposing only what is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheritance:** Inheritance allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the characteristics and behaviors of an existing class (base class or parent class). This promotes code reuse and helps create a hierarchy of classes with shared attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects and allows for flexibility in the design of software.\n",
