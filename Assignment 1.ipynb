    "\n",
    "1. **Integer (`int`):**\n",
    "   - Integers represent whole numbers without any decimal points.\n",
    "   - Examples: `0`, `-10`, `42`, `1000`.\n",
    "   - Integer arithmetic in Python follows typical mathematical rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Floating-point (`float`):**\n",
    "   - Floating-point numbers represent real numbers and can have decimal points.\n",
    "   - Examples: `3.14`, `0.5`, `-2.0`, `100.25`.\n",
    "   - Floating-point arithmetic may have some precision issues due to the nature of how floating-point numbers are represented in a computer.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **String (`str`):**\n",
    "   - Strings represent sequences of characters, such as text.\n",
    "   - Examples: `\"Hello\"`, `'Python'`, `\"123\"`, `'Special Characters: !@#$'`.\n",
    "   - Strings are immutable in Python, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Boolean (`bool`):**\n",
    "  - Represents the truth values `True` or `False`.\n",
    "  - Often used in conditional statements and logical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "- **List:**\n",
    "  - Represents an ordered, mutable collection of elements.\n",
    "  - Elements can be of different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tuple:**\n",
    "  - Similar to a list but immutable once created.\n",
    "  - Used for grouping related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dictionary (`dict`):**\n",
